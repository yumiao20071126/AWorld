> **Build, evaluate and run General Multi-Agent Assistance with ease**

Through AWorld (short for Agent World), you can quickly build real-world scenarios or task automation into agentic prototypes, then extend them into a generic agent or a team of agents to assist your real needs, like Manus.

*Hope AWorld would guide you into the AGI World. GLHF!*

## Installation
With pip (Python>=3.11):
```bash
pip install aworld
```

## Usage
Easily configure and run a pre-defined agent through our web interface:
```bash
aworld-web start
```
Next, input a user query for a quick test. Below are two demos showcasing how a single agent can use both a browser and a phone, respectively.
