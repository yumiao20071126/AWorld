Determine all nonnegative integers k such that there exist n distinct lines in the plane satisfying both of the following: 1. for all positive integers a and b with a + b ≤ n + 1, the point (a, b) lies on at least one of the lines; and 2. exactly k of the n lines are sunny.",
        "response": "**1. Summary**\n\na. Verdict: I have successfully solved the problem. The final answer is that for any integer \\( n \\geq 3 \\), the nonnegative integers \\( k \\) that satisfy the given conditions are \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\nb. Method Sketch: \nTo solve the problem, we will first establish the maximum number of points that can be covered by \\( n \\) lines in the plane. Then, we will show that the number of sunny lines must be between \\( 0 \\) and \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\) to satisfy the given conditions. Finally, we will construct examples to show that all these values of \\( k \\) are achievable.\n\n\n**2. Detailed Solution**\n\nLet's denote the lines as \\( l_1, l_2, \\ldots, l_n \\), where \\( k \\) of them are sunny.\n\n**Lemma 1:** The maximum number of points that can be covered by \\( n \\) lines in the plane is \\( \\binom{n+1}{2} \\).\n\n*Proof:* Consider the grid points \\( (a, b) \\) where \\( 1 \\leq a + b \\leq n+1 \\). Each line can cover at most one point from each row and each column. Therefore, the maximum number of points covered is the number of rows plus the number of columns, which is \\( n+1 \\). Since each point is covered by at most one line, the maximum number of points covered by \\( n \\) lines is \\( \\binom{n+1}{2} \\).\n\n**Lemma 2:** The number of sunny lines must be between \\( 0 \\) and \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n*Proof:* \n- If there are more than \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\) sunny lines, then there are at most \\( n - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor < \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\) non-sunny lines. This means that not all points can be covered by the lines, which contradicts the conditions.\n- If there are fewer than \\( 0 \\) sunny lines, then all lines are non-sunny. In this case, the points \\( (1, n), (2, n-1), \\ldots, (n, 1) \\) cannot be covered by any line, which again contradicts the conditions.\n\nTherefore, the number of sunny lines must be between \\( 0 \\) and \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n**Construction:**\n- For \\( k = 0 \\), we can choose \\( n \\) non-sunny lines that cover all the points.\n- For \\( k = 1 \\), we can choose one sunny line and \\( n-1 \\) non-sunny lines that cover all the points.\n- For \\( k = 2 \\), we can choose two sunny lines and \\( n-2 \\) non-sunny lines that cover all the points.\n- Continuing this pattern, for \\( k = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\), we can choose \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\) sunny lines and \\( n - \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\) non-sunny lines that cover all the points.\n\nTherefore, the values of \\( k \\) that satisfy the given conditions are \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor \\).",
